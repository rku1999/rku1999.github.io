The name "kukaburra" is not a real word. It is a word play on the Australian native kookaburra bird together with my last name. As an Australian who lives overseas, this is my way of paying homage. The kookaburra bird is known for its ridiculous yet rather comedic calling sound that resembles [human laughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0ZbykXlg6Q). And as a person who loves to laugh, I hope this blog will reflect that part of my personality and maybe, just maybe, make the world smile a little more.
