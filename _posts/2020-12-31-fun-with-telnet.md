As computer science students, we always strive to find new ways to see things and do things while having a bit of fun along the way.
So, if you're a Star Wars fan like me, the next time you find yourself rewatching Star Wars, why not try an ascii version.

If you simply type `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl` at your terminal, you should be able to watch the full ascii version of 
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. Pretty neat eh?

p.s. This is a pretty old telnet gag. I learned this from my web systems professor (honestly hands down one of the best
professors I've ever had).
