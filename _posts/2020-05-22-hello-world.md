**Hello world!**

This will officially mark the nth time I've written the phrase "Hello World". But somehow, it never gets boring.

I've never really blogged before in my life. But I guess there's a first time for everything. I created this blog thanks to the inspiration from my brother, who also started blogging a few months ago.

My main goal for this blog is to:

1. Log my progress as a computer science student in college and hope that it resonates with other fellow students out there.
2. Document important, interesting, and even not so interesting events that I go through each day.
3. Record down my thoughts and feelings about pretty much anything.

Now, the name "kukaburra" is not a real word. It is a word play on the Australian native kookaburra bird together with my last name. As an Australian who lives overseas, this is my way of paying homage. The kookaburra bird is known for its ridiculous calling sound that resembles [human laughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0ZbykXlg6Q). And I hope this will reflect that part of my personality and the essence of this blog. 

Anyways, I don't really know what to expect from this blog. All I can say is that I'm pretty excited.
