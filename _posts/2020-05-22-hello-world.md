**Hello world!**
This will officially mark the nth time I've written the phrase "Hello World". I've never really blogged before in my life. But I guess there's a first time for everything. I created this blog thanks to the inspiration from my brother, who also started blogging a few months ago.
Now, the name "kukaburra" is not a real word. It is a word play with the kookaburra bird and my last name. As an Australian who lives overseas, this is my way of paying homage.
Anyways, I don't really know what to expect from this blog. All I can say is that I'm pretty excited.
