## PhotoOp
PhotoOp is a C++ JPEG image decoder that can extract information such as dates, image dimensions, GPS information, and more. It is able to process through a large amount of images within a short period of time due to its multithreaded approach. I applied it to my family's photo album and thougth that I could then use this to build a web app that would allow my family and I to query for our images without having to go through the entire photo directory every time.
- Setup a Postgres database server on a local desktop at home to store the relevant photo information and hosted an API server with JavaScript and Express so that I can query for those images.
- Created a website with React and Node.js framework.
- TODO: Build a facial recognition model with GCP's AutoML or OpenCV and integrate it with my website which will provide a useful feature that allows querying the images based on faces.
