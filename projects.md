## Stock Market Trend Predictor
- Built **LSTM** baseline model to predict NASDAQ index trends with Reddit sentiment.
- Improved results with new **DistilBERT** model and fine-tuned hyperparameters.
- Extracted sentiment and word embeddings from NTUSD-Fin: A Market Sentiment Dictionary for Financial Social Media Data Applications
- Tuned hyperparameters and resulted with 72% accuracy.

## Clothing Classifier
- Built a **DenseNet CNN** to predict types of clothing from images.
- Improved training via image augmentation techniques such as cropping, distortions, and adjustments to hue and brightness.
- Tuned hyperparameters and selection of activation function to achieve 61% accuracy.
- Top 1 of 350 students in EECS 445 (Fall 2020) for most accurate CNN model.

## Yelp Review Predictor
- Built a **SVC** to predict positive and negative Yelp reviews.
- Utilized bag-of-word model with **spaCy** in combination with **vaderSentiment**.
- Improved by using **PyTorch** **RoBERTa** pre-training technique for feature extraction.
- Compared cross-validation results with linear, quadratic, and RBF kernels.
- Tuned hyperparameters and resulted with 79.2% accuracy.
- Top 1 of 350 students in EECS 445 (Fall 2020) for most accurate SVM model.

## PhotoOp
PhotoOp is a C++ JPEG image decoder that can extract information such as dates, image dimensions, GPS information, and more. It is able to process through a large amount of images within a short period of time due to its multithreaded approach. I used it to index my family's photo album and built a web app that would allow my family and I to query for our images without having to go through the entire photo directory every time.
- Built a multi-threaded indexer in **C++** to quickly index 30,000+ family photos.
- Used a **Postgres** database to store the indexed information.
- Built an API with **NodeJS** and a website with **React** to allow my family to query photos by date and or location keywords.

## ZeroHero

ZeroHero is a cross-platform mobile app that will suggest healthy and delicious recipes based on pictures of your leftover ingredients.

- Built an image recognition model using **Google AutoML** with 2,000+ images.
- Developed a cross-platform app using **React Native**.

## Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)
MATE ROV is an international underwater robotics competition that foucses on inspiring students to come up with creative solutions to solve potential underwater environmental problems.

- Was the COO and head of mechanic subteam
- Responsible for the design and piloting of the team's ROV
- Designed and created a master-slave robotic arm system. Master arm would control the movement of the slave arm from shore.
- Led the team to achieve Top 10 in overall score and 1st place in technical presentation
