After I created this blog, I went on to read more about the kookaburra birds and I discovered that their "laughing" call was actually used to establish territory among family groups.

If a rival tribe is within earshot and replies, the whole family flocks in and literally laughs out loud. I'd like to imagine it as them laughing at the other family and mocking them. But maybe they're laughing simply because Why so serious?  

So, start with a low, hiccuping chuckle, then throw your head back in a raucous laughter. Because from time to time, that's simply all we need.
