During one of my machine learning lecutures a couple of days ago, we were talking about decision trees. My professor was trying to explain the concept of entropy and information gain by illustrating an example of predicting whether flights will be canceled based on certain features (wind, temperature, ...etc.).

And that got me thinking. This seems like a good idea! Are there any companies that provide this service of predicting how likely a flight is going to be canceled based on certain factors? Because this seems pretty useful. If you can tell me that there is a 70% chance my flight is going to be canceled based on some circumstances, I'm most likely not going to purchase a ticket for that particular flight anymore.

So I enthusiastically thought about this idea for a couple of hours, but then I suddnely came to a realization: This idea of a flight predictor isn't as useful or helpful as I thought. Because if you think about how most consumers purchase plane tickets, they usually make a decision weeks or months or even years before the actual flight date. This means. Nevertheless, this can still be a pretty cool project that I can do to put into practice the materials I learned in class.
