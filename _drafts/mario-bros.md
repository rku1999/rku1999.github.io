This post has been sitting in my drafts folder for some time now, to be more precise, since the summer of 2020. The idea for this post originated from one of my college essay drafts. And even though I ended up choosing some other topic to submit, there was always a part of me that really wanted to finish this piece.
Later, when I started this blog in the summer of 2020, I knew that this was one of the first few drafts I wanted to write. And I planned on publishing this on a momentous day.
Which brings us to today, my brother's wedding day. So I guess today is as appropriate of a day as it gets. This post tells a story of my brother and I  through the lens of a 6-year-old me. I hope this post fills you with nostalgia and blissful memories from our past.

Here's to all the fond memories of our past and those that are yet to be made.


<div aling="center"><i>To my brother Kevin,</i></div>

"From simply playing video games at home to playing together on family trips to Vancouver, you’ve always been there in my memory and image of our family.” I found this letter on my bed sheets when I returned home from sending my brother off to college. Tears were streaming down my cheeks as I was reading it, and so did the memories from our childhood.

“It's-a me, Mario!” The nostalgic, high pitched voice of the Italian plumber constantly reoccurred in my head. It was the end of summer of 2012, when my family and I were sending my brother off to college. On the night before the departure, I knew I was going to have to leave it all behind.

When I was little, playing video games with my brother was my life. Starting with the PlayStation 1, the first gaming system that we had built our memories upon. Even now, I can still vividly recall the contour of that grey, old, dusty box squeaking whenever I opened the lid. Yet, that unassuming little box bonded my brother and I closer than ever. The nostalgic memories bring me back to the glorious days of kindergarten, when I would race up the stairs as if I was possessed by the bouncy sounds of tossing fireballs and the crisp, sparkly sound of the gold coins. How that excited me! I would rush into the house with my bag still hanging from my shoulders, grab a controller, and join the game as Luigi next to my brother, Mario.

"Let's-a go!" We would laugh hysterically while stomping on evil mushrooms and dancing turtles. We would scream on top of our lungs while trying to avoid getting eaten by carnivorous flowers. We would explore the undergrounds accompanied by strange and mysterious techno music, tingling my nerves on every beat. We would jolt up with the adrenaline rush while beating evil bosses. We would do all that for one goal and one reason only: to rescue Princess Peach. It never gets old! Even as we got older, the same exhilaration and excitement still radiates through our faces as we continue our explorations.

As more and more pixels were added to the faces of Mario and Luigi, it became rarer for them to rescue the princess. However, we would still revisit the wonderland from time to time. Whenever we’re playing together, time vanishes.
That night, surrounded by bleak darkness, I was in a state of confusion and sadness. I couldn’t bear the thought of letting him go. I really miss him. I really miss his company. The game will never be the same with only Luigi playing. The spirit of playing the game will not be the same. Nothing will be the same. I will not be the same. I realized deep down that I had always been in denial about his departure, about leaving childhood behind. I had always expected things to stay the same because I was afraid of change. Tears were flowing down as if all those memories were being drained out of my head. And I knew: Childhood is over.

Then, it occurred to me. Some things are inevitable, and most of the times you can’t do anything to stop it. Even if this includes letting go something that you genuinely care for. However, when things change, it does not mean they will disappear or lose their value forever. The wonderful times that we had created together will always stay in my memories, our memories, I’m sure. They will become something that I can look back and smile upon, something that I can recollect and imagine as if I was back in yesteryear. "Okey dokey!" The tears were flowing down not because of sadness anymore, but because of gratitude. It was because of all the amazing times that we’ve had together. It was because of all the laughter, screaming, enthusiasm, frustration, and happiness that came with these memories. It was because I know I will cherish them eternally and I will forever be thankful of him.

Now that you've finally rescued your final Princess Peach, all I can say is that don't let Bowser snatch her away.

“I hope the transition isn’t too hard for you as I go to college. We have been living together since you were born! … I hope that our time together has been very exciting and memorable for you.”

I can still remember when I was five, we “set up camp” in the living room. Stuffing bowls of junk food and candies and bringing bottles of soda into our tent, we were determined to survive. We even built a tunnel to our room using nothing but pillows and blankets. And the time when we 

It was because of all the fun times that we’ve had together. It was because of all the laughter, excitement, enthusiasm, frustration, and happiness that came with these memories. It was because I know I will cherish these memories forever.
