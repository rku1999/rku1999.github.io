This post has been sitting in my drafts folder for some time now, to be precise, the summer of 2020. The idea for this post originated from one of my college essay drafts. However, I ended up choosing some other topic to submit.
Later, when I started this blog in the summer of 2020, I knew that this was one of the first few drafts I wanted to write.And I planned on publishing this on a momentous day.
Which brings us to today, my brother's wedding day. So I guess today is as appropriate of a day as it gets. This post tells a story of my brother and I  through the lens of a 6-year-old me. I hope this post fills you with nostalgia and blissful memories from our past.
Here's to all the fond memories of our past and those that are yet to be created.
